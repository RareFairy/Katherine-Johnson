					<h2>What Did She Do for NASA?</h2>
					<p>In 1962, the United States decided to send people to the Moon. That was big news. Getting to and from the Moon would take a lot of work. As the U.S. space agency, NASA would have to solve many, many problems. So NASA created large teams to solve them.</p>
					<p>Katherine studied how to use geometry for space travel. She figured out the paths for the spacecraft to orbit (go around) Earth and to land on the Moon. NASA used Katherine's math, and it worked! NASA sent astronauts into orbit around Earth. Later, her math helped send astronauts to the Moon and back. NASA could not have done these things without Katherine Johnson and her love for math!</p>

			<h3>Things to Know!</h3>
			<ol class="facts">
				<li>In the 1950s, there were no computers like we have today. People had to solve hard math problems by themselves. They often used adding machines and rulers. These people were called “computers.” The NACA (NASA) hired women to work as computers.</li><br>
				<li>Getting to the Moon is not easy. Rockets and spacecraft cannot fly in a straight line to get there, even though it seems like they could.</li><br>
				<li>Astronaut John Glenn went in orbit in 1962. He was the first American to orbit our planet. Then, NASA’s Apollo 11 landed on the Moon on July 20, 1969. Neil Armstrong was the first human to walk on the Moon. He and his crewmates, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins, returned to Earth four days later.</li>
